# Spec Management

## When to Use

- Creating new feature specifications
- Organizing existing documentation
- Planning complex features
- Reviewing spec completeness
- Archiving implemented specs

## When to Create a Spec

Create a spec when:
- Feature takes more than 2-3 days to implement
- Multiple people will work on the feature
- Feature spans frontend and backend
- Significant architectural decisions needed
- External dependencies or integrations involved
- Feature requires stakeholder sign-off

Skip a spec when:
- Simple bug fix or minor enhancement
- Well-understood change with clear scope
- Task completable in a few hours
- No cross-team coordination needed

## Spec Location

```
project/
└── specs/
    ├── specs.md              # Template (copy this)
    ├── frontend/             # Frontend feature specs
    │   └── user-profile.md
    └── backend/              # Backend service specs
        └── user-api.md
```

### Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for filenames: `user-authentication.md`
- Name reflects the feature: `payment-processing.md`, not `sprint-14-work.md`
- Keep names concise but descriptive

## Spec Structure

Every spec should include these sections:

### Required Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Overview** | Feature name, type, status, author, date |
| **Business Context** | Problem statement, goals, non-goals |
| **Requirements** | Functional and non-functional requirements |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Testable criteria for completion |
| **Technical Approach** | High-level implementation strategy |

### Optional Sections

| Section | When to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **UI/UX** | Frontend specs with mockups |
| **API Design** | Backend specs with endpoints |
| **Data Model** | Database changes needed |
| **Dependencies** | External services, libraries |
| **Rollout Plan** | Phased rollout, feature flags |
| **Rollback Plan** | How to revert if issues arise |

## Related Specs

When specs have dependencies, link them bidirectionally:

```markdown
## Related Specs
- Frontend: frontend/user-profile-page.md
  - Implements the UI for this service
- Backend: backend/user-service.md
  - Provides the API endpoints for this feature
- Related: backend/media-service.md
  - Handles image processing for user profiles
```

**Rules:**
- Use relative paths from specs root
- Include brief description of the relationship
- Update both specs when creating links
- Update links when moving or renaming specs

## Writing Good Acceptance Criteria

### SMART Criteria

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Specific** | Clearly defined, no ambiguity |
| **Measurable** | Can verify completion |
| **Achievable** | Technically feasible |
| **Relevant** | Tied to feature goals |
| **Testable** | Can write tests for it |

### Examples

**Good criteria:**
```markdown
- [ ] User can upload profile image up to 5MB
- [ ] Image is resized to 200x200 for thumbnail
- [ ] Profile updates reflect within 5 seconds
- [ ] Error message shown if image upload fails
- [ ] Profile image persists across sessions
```

**Bad criteria:**
```markdown
- [ ] Profile should work well
- [ ] Good user experience
- [ ] Fast performance
- [ ] Handle all edge cases
```

                                            │ Archived │
                                            └──────────┘
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Initial version, still being written |
| **Review** | Ready for stakeholder review |
| **Approved** | Approved for implementation |
| **In Progress** | Implementation started |
| **Implemented** | Feature shipped, spec complete |
| **Archived** | Moved to archive after 30 days |
| **Rejected** | Not approved, will not implement |

### Archive Policy

1. Mark spec as "Implemented" with date when feature ships
2. After 30 days, move to `specs/archive/`
3. Keep archived specs for historical reference
4. Delete archived specs after 1 year (optional)

## Spec Review Process

### Before Review

- [ ] All required sections complete
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Related specs are linked
- [ ] Technical approach reviewed with team
- [ ] No open questions or TODOs

### Review Checklist

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Scope** | Is scope clearly defined? Any ambiguity? |
| **Feasibility** | Is this technically achievable? |
| **Dependencies** | Are all dependencies identified? |
| **Edge Cases** | Are edge cases documented? |
| **Testing** | Can we write tests for this? |
| **Rollback** | How do we revert if needed? |

## Templates

Copy from [templates/](templates/) directory:

- **spec-template.md** - Full feature spec template
- **bug-spec-template.md** - Bug fix spec (simplified)
- **spike-template.md** - Research/investigation template

## Scripts

Available automation:

```bash
# Validate spec completeness
python scripts/validate-spec.py specs/frontend/my-feature.md

# Archive old implemented specs
./scripts/archive-old-specs.sh

# List specs by status
./scripts/list-specs.sh --status=draft
```

## Best Practices

### Do

- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Include concrete examples
- Get early feedback on drafts
- Update specs as requirements change
- Link related specs bidirectionally
- Include non-goals to limit scope

### Don't

- Mix frontend and backend in one spec
- Leave vague acceptance criteria
- Skip the rollback plan
- Forget to update status
- Let specs go stale
- Over-engineer simple features
