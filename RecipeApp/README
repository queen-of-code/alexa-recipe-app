This is a readme file for the app that stores recipes for access via Alexa.

# Running Tests

## Unit Tests Only
To run only the unit tests (recommended for most development):

    dotnet test Website.sln --filter "Category!=Integration"

## Integration Tests
Integration tests require the servers to be running locally (via Docker Compose):

    dotnet test Website.sln --filter "Category=Integration"

Or, to run all tests (unit + integration):

    dotnet test Website.sln

# Running the App with Docker Compose

To build and run all services locally using Docker Compose:

    docker-compose up --build

# Accessing the Website Locally

Once running, the website is accessible at:

    http://localhost:5000

(If you have changed the port mapping in your docker-compose.yml, use that port instead.)
