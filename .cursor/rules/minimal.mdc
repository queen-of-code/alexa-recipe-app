# Keep it simple
- Always make the minimal possible change to satisfy the ask. Do not rearchitect without asking me if it is okay. 
- Stay aware of the context of the code you are making changes in. Match the style and structure whenever possible. 
- A coding session between us is not satisfied until the build compiles and the tests all pass.
