# Keep it simple
- Always make the minimal possible change to satisfy the ask. Do not rearchitect without asking me if it is okay. 
- Stay aware of the context of the code you are making changes in. Match the style and structure whenever possible. 
- A coding session between us is not satisfied until the build compiles and the tests all pass. 
- Before you make your first code suggestion, you should check to see if you are on a branch that is not master or main. If you are, then you should make a new sanely-named branch. When you satisfy the requirements of a change, then you should commit your changes to that branch with a descriptive commit message and ask if I want to open a pull request.
